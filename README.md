## Project Overview

Managing supplier relationships is crucial for business success. This project applies data analytics to assess supplier performance, uncover patterns, and support better decision-making through Power BI dashboards.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes supplier-related information such as:

- **Supplier ID**: Unique identifier for each supplier
- **Delivery Time**: Time taken by the supplier to deliver goods
- **Cost Efficiency**: Comparison of supplier costs to industry standards
- **Quality Ratings**: Ratings given based on delivered product quality
- **Order Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly fulfilled orders
- **On-Time Performance**: Percentage of on-time deliveries

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntBap23/Supplier-Analysis.git
   cd Supplier-Analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that `requirements.txt` is available in the repository with all necessary dependencies listed.*

## Usage

The dataset is generated using a Jupyter Notebook, which prepares the data for Power BI analysis. Follow these steps:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open** `data_preparation.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Load the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
   - Create visualizations for supplier performance.
   - Perform trend analysis using interactive visuals.
